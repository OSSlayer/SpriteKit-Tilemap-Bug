I opened back up Xcode after putting the initial files on here and I added a new tile called "House". 
First I went into .xcassets and dragged and dropped the house tile in there. Then I went to the tilemap and made a new tile group and dragged and dropped again
This caused the other tiles to become blurry. I hit cmd + s and put the files on here.
