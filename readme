After doing the two tests which are in the initial/ and broken/ directiories, I did some more testing. 
First I opened Xcode again just to see if it was fixed but it was not.
Then I downloaded the first version which was working and I replaced the Xcode project as that one. The tiles were back to clear like in the initial version

This means something has changed inside the save files
